## Project Objective

The project objective was to enhance the existing API by integrating MongoDB, allowing us to create, manage, and retrieve data from a local MongoDB database using a command-line interface (CLI) tool.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Seeded Cars Data into MongoDB

- Developed a CLI tool in Node.js to seed data into the local MongoDB database and provided the capability to delete data from it.
- Ensured that the CLI tool was source-controlled and included the seed data, enabling team members to seed data by cloning the repository.

### Task 2: Displayed Similar Cars from Your Stock

- Modified the existing car-finder API to retrieve cars matching specified search criteria from the MongoDB instance.
- Optionally created a frontend page that allowed users to upload cars and view matched cars.
