# Project Title

We developed a command-line interface (CLI) tool to seed data into our local MongoDB database, delete data from it, and modified our Mission 02 API to retrieve cars that matched a specified search criteria from our MongoDB instance. Also we created a frontend page that allows users to upload cars and view matched cars.
